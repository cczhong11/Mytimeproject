# Calendar and task-list
## Purpose
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can combine calendar and to-do lists, with some log and analysis function.

I usually used task-list and Calendar separaterly, but it is not conveniennt. If I could put to do item to calendar and mark as down in the calendar, this task was also done in the task lists. I also want this system included my daily log and summary. It could gave me a understanding of my daily life.
